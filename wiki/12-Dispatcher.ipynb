    "# NoPE - Dispatcher\n",
    "\n",
    "The NoPE-Dispatcher is designed as Layer between the different Modules / Dispatchers. They allow distributed computing or just a simple ***Service oriented Architecture*** (*SOA*). A dispatcher is used to link the modules, share data and events and provide a remote procedure call (rpc) interface.\n",

    "| `connectivityManager` | establishes a connection to other dispatchers and manages the status of the remotely connected dispatchers. It checks their health and removes dead dispatchers. |\n",
    "| `eventDistributor` | shares events accross the network (or internally). You can use this element to listen for specific events. The subscription to those events allows `mqtt`-patterns. Additionaly, you are allowed to emit event on specific topics, or pattern based topics |\n",
    "| `dataDistributor` | shares data accross the network (or internally). In comperisson to events, data is persistent and is available all the time. You can use this sub-module to listen for specific data-changes (install data-hooks), pull specific data or push data. You can pull / push data using a `mqtt`-pattern based path. |\n",
    "| `rpcManager` | Used to perform `remote procedure calls` (see [here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Procedure_Call)). The manager keeps track of the available services. You must use the sub-module to register/unregister (new) services. |\n",
    "| `instanceManager` | Used to create/dispose (remote) instances. The manager keeps track of the available instances in the network, allows to create `wrappers` for those instances. You must use the sub-module to register/unregister (new) instances. To allow the system to provide a service for creating instances of as specific type, you can provide a generator and provide it as `service`. |\n",
